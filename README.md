An un-optimized gravity-sim
I do not recommend running with more than 100 particles

# Adding particles
You can press '+' on the numberpad to generate a random particle, or you can press multiple numbers on the top of your keyboard (ex 1, 6, 7, and 4) to generate a particle with that mass, a random position, random velocity, and random density
(1, 6, 7, and 4 would produce a particle with a mass of 1674)
